# Drug Use and Abuse
## By Bradley Balansay, Sam Chiang, Pranav Kartha, and McKinley Harvey
### Final Project for INFO 201

This information comes from Data.gov and is all about drug use.
Our data comes from two sources. The first source contains information about
different age groups and the frequency they use different drugs. The other data source contains information about accidental drug overdoses that led to death.

Look into the different tabs and choose between years, ages, and other options to explore the data
